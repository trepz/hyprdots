Eternal WIP.

## Packages

TODO: Install script so this is easier between machines. Standard Arch or EOS base and then these via arch repo or AUR. I should have made this as I went on the first install, but I will just update it as I get my other machines up to speed, might be a bit behind in the meantime.

## Setup notes

Just some quick reminders when setting up an environment.

- use stable rust default

`rustup default stable`

- set up node

Install nvm via fisher.

`fisher install jorgebucaran/nvm.fish`

Install LTS node or whatever is needed.

`nvm install lts`

The fish start script has nvm use lts inside it.
